# Adding an External API Subdomain to Zeit Now Projects

This will be a quick one, but will hopefully help anyone going through the Google / Github / StackOverflow vortex of doom trying to find a succinct answer as to how to add an external api to a Zeit Now project :)

The Scenario: We have a front-end project that we host on Zeit Now. We have a back-end server hosted somewhere else, like on AWS Lightsail or Digital Ocean. We are own the domain example.com and have pointed the domain at the Zeit Now nameservers.

The Goal: We want api.example.com to point to our back-end server...

If you've added your main domain to Zeit and pointed your domain at the Zeit nameservers, the next step can be a little confusing at first. I went through the Zeit Now dashboard a few times and couldn't find a way to easily add subdomains and point them at external services, until I realized that Zeit puts the emphasis on using the Now CLI, and suddenly things made a lot more sense. The detailed instructions can be found here: https://zeit.co/docs/v2/advanced/domains/dns#using-now-cli/now-dns-add

It's way simpler than it seems :)

1. In the Now CLI, you can first check your current config with the following command:

`now dns ls`

2. Then you can add a new record with this command syntax

`now dns add <domain> <name> <record type> <value>`

- For example:

`now dns add mytoplevel.com subdomain A 127.0.0.1`

The above code would add a subdomain to your top level domain and point it as an A record to 127.0.0.1 (of course that would be the server IP address or another domain name).

- Here's one more example to make it clear:

`now dns add example.com api A 127.0.0.1`

The above code will make api.example.com point to 127.0.0.1 with an A record controlled by Zeit's DNS.

That's pretty much it. The big thing that I didn't realize at first was:

> Once you've pointed your domain at the Zeit nameservers, you can control pretty much anything via the Now CLI

I hope that helps ðŸ™‹
