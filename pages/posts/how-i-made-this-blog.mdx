# How I Made This Blog

Over the past couple of years I've written a few blog posts and published them on Medium, mainly because the writing & publishing experience on Medium was generally straightforward and friction-free. However, recently I became concerned about vendor lock-in, frustrated with Medium's ridiculous commenting system and annoyed by the pay-wall they've started using. With my dev-sense tingling it seemed like a good time to explore the static-site ecosystem, since a large number of interesting options have been generating buzz lately..

##### Criteria

My criteria for choosing a tech stack was the following:

- The stack should be light-weight
- I'd prefer to write in Markdown and code in JS
- Deployment should be simple
- I should be able to achieve a 95+ Pagespeed score on desktop & mobile without too much hassle
- A solid community & good documentation would be nice :)

##### Gatsby vs Next.js vs Hugo vs...

The big names in the static site space are Hugo, Next.js, Nuxt, Gatsby and Jekyll. But scratch the surface and you'll find 10s and even hundreds of other options - a site like [staticgen](https://www.staticgen.com/) lists more than you could ever hope to try out. While Jekyll and Hugo have great reputations, at this point I didn't want to further complicate things by having to deal with Ruby or Go, so that ruled them out. I have experience with Vue but I was also hoping to improve my React skills, so I crossed Next and VuePress off the list.

After reviewing a number of choices I narrowed down the field to Gatsby and Next.js. Gatsby has rocketed into the JAMstack conversation as a favourite static site generator, and it integrates with Markdown via MDX, plus it has lots of plug-n-play integrations that make it an attractive option. I recently did Jason Lengstorf's Gatsby course on Front-End Masters to get a feel for it, and while I was impressed with some features and appreciated how easy it was in some parts, I didn't _love_ the fact I'd have to rely heavily on GraphQL in order to make a super simple website with blog posts. I think GraphQL has some really exciting capabilities but I'm also weary of the 'hammer' approach of using complex technology to achieve simple tasks - to do a simple thing like write a blog IMO you shouldn't need to jump on the latest bleeding-edge tech.

The other option I was seriously considering was Next.js. The team at Zeit have been pumping out amazing products for a few years now and Next.js's approach made it dead simple to get a website up & running, while also including the ability to work with Styled Components (or Emotion, et al) and MDX.
