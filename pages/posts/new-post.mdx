# The Queen of Ice

The year is 2020. A bitter, elderly woman with wealth but no immediate family opts to be cryogenically frozen when she is diagnosed with an inoperable, malignant brain tumor.

The year is 2083. Ann Margaret Wyche is resurrected into a world that on the surface bears no resemblance to the one she left. Her fortune is intact, having weathered several global financial crises by an algorithmic money management firm. Her body has been rejuvenated and sparkles with life, unlike the jaded mind within. With no contemporaries and a long life ahead of her, she must discover what she wants to make of her fresh start, create new bonds in a strange time, and find out that not everything in the past remains there.
