      <p>
        In this blog I hope to add code discoveries, TILs, things I've learned
        while learning along with random tidbits I'll publish every now and
        then. Since the blog is basically a collection of mdx posts stored in
        Github you can expect that posts will usually be in a permanent WIP
        state - I'll update them if & when I have the time ðŸ‘Œ
