    <p>
      I’m a lifelong learner and self-starter. I read avidly (lots of
      non-fiction & sci-fi), create content online and also follow artistic
      pursuits including music production & digital collage. I’m a good
      networker, listener, and speaker, and I enjoy building strong,
      long-lasting relationships with people.
